In Next.js 15, a relatively uncommon bug can occur when using server components with deeply nested data structures or circular references.  If a server component attempts to serialize a large or complex object graph containing cycles, it might lead to a `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` error. This happens because the serialization process recursively traverses the object, and a circular reference can create an infinite loop.
